        <h2>YOU GOTTA USE GOOD FLOUR AND GOOD WATER</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of double zero(00) pizza flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of dry bread yeast</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of spring water</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoon pink salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (approximately) of the best uncured pepperoni you can find</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
    </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees fahrenheit.</li>
                <li>Combine water, flour, salt and yeast into mixing bowl. It is suggested to use a mixer with dough hook attachment. Mix for 2 minutes on low.</li>
                <li>Cover mixed dough and let rise for 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Thinly slice pepperoni no more than an 1/8 inch thick. Thinner the better.</li>
                <li>Slice mozzarella cheese about 1/4 thick. You want 2-3 tablespoons of mozzarella per roll depending on how Siciilian you are.</li>
                <li>Lightly spread oil on cast iron baking pan.</li>
                <li>Oil hands and pull off approximately 1/4 cup of dough from batch.</li>
                <li>Form a ball with the dough in your hands and then smash it flat while it is still in your hands. Insert pepperoni and cheese.</li>    
                <li>Carefully pinch the dough shut and make sure there are no thin spots or holes that cheese or pepperoni juice can escape from. </li>
                <li>Repeat until you run out of ingredients.</li>
                <li>Bake for 10 minutes or until golden brown. When the cheese starts making it way out on its own you know they're about done.</li>
                <li>Serve with a glass of milk.</li>
            
            </ol>
