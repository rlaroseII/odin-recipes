    <h2>REGULAR PANCAKES ARE EVIL</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of all purpose flour</li>
            <li>12 eggs</li>
            <li>3 cups of plain greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of vanilla extract </li>
            <li>3 cups of frozen mixed berries </li>
            <li>1/8 cup of coconut flour</li>
            <li>1/8 cup of unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat cast iron skillet on medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>If using frozen fruit make sure to start thawing fruit on stove in sauce pan. Use potatoe masher to mash once thawed.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl add eggs, flour(coconut and regular), yogurt, baking soda and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Mix ingredients on high for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add one tablespoon of butter to cast iron skillet and add 1/2 cup of batter to hot pan.</li>
            <li>Use a spatula to flip pancake after determining that it is cooked through enough. If not it may fall apart while flipping. Adjust heat accordingly.</li>
            <li>Serve with mashed fruit, as much butter as you like (since its unsalted and wont overwhelm the flavor) and a glass of milk.</li>
        </ol>
